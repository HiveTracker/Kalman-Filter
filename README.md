# Kalman-Filter

Here will be presented Kalman Filter for IMU+HiveTracker.

There is two files :
  - The simulation : which is Python code for Blender app. It will simulate a random position of a cube in space. And in the same time, the position calculted will be shown.
  - The Kalman Filter : it will estimate the true position of the cube. It will use IMU simulation and HiveTracker.
